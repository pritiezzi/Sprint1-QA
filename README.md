Test Design

•In this project I started by analyzing the requirements for the Urban Routes app and presented them as a mind map to ensure all parts of the requirements have been accounted for in testing, while identifying possible grey areas. 
•I designed test cases for the input fields testing class and boundary values as well as tests for calculating travel time and cost in the Urban Routes app at different travel start times.
